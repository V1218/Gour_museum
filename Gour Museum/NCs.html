        <h2>NATIONAL SERVICE SCHEME (NSS) </h2>
        <p>
          National Service Scheme, under the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports Government of India, popularly 
            known   as   NSS   was launched in Gandhi ji's birth centenary year 1969, in 37 universities involving 
            40,000 students with primary focus on the development of personality of students through community service.
             Today, NSS has more than 3.2 million student volunteers on its roll spread over 298 Universities and 42
              (+2) Senior Secondary Councils and Directorate of Vocational Education all over the country. 
              From its inception, more than 3.75 crore students from Universities, College and Institutions 
              of higher learning have benefitted from NSS activities, as student volunteers.<br>
              Even before the launching of this scheme in Dr.Harisingh Gour Vishwavidyalaya, Sagar, Madhya Pradesh,
               all the department programmes were guided by the philosophy of extension& outreach, and the role of
                co-curricular activities for the all-round development of students has been acknowledged. The National 
                Service Scheme thus continues to uphold and reinforce these traditions with dignity and pride. NSS
                 programme in the Vishwavidyalaya has expanded both qualitatively and quantitatively, and has grown
                  into a mainstream activity over the years. Starting with a sanctioned strength of 200 volunteers,
                   it will be extended with more units in coming sessions.
