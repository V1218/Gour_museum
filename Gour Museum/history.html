        <h2>Vishwavidyalaya</h2>
        <p>Doctor Harisingh Gour Vishwavidyalaya Sagar, formerly University of Saugor, was established on 18th July 1946 by Dr. 
            Sir Hari Singh Gour (Nov. 26, 1870 – Dec. 25, 1949) by his lifetime savings. This 18th University of India and the 
            oldest and the biggest University of Madhya Pradesh has perhaps the singular distinction of being founded by the 
            munificence of a single person's hard earned money of about two crore of rupees. Apart from being a great jurist 
            and legal luminary par excellence, he was a great Patriot, Philanthropist, Educationist and Social Reformer.
            Dr. Hari Singh Gour was the first Vice-Chancellor of University of Delhi (1922 to 1926) and first Dean (1924) 
            of The Faculty of Law in the University of Delhi. Dr. Hari Singh Gour also held the position of Vice-Chancellor
             of the Nagpur University, (two times in 1928 and 1936). Dr. Gour was the founder Vice–Chancellor of the Sagar 
             University (1946). The Govt. of India honored his memory by issuing a commemorative postage stamp in 1976.
             </p>
             <p> The University was rechristened as Doctor Hari Singh Gour Vishwavidyalaya in February 1983 by the State 
              Legislature. The University is situated 5 Km east of Sagar city and its campus covers an area of 1312.89 a
              cres over Pathariya hills connected to the Vindhya Range, surrounded by lush green forest (about 100 acres)
               within its campus and has effectively contributed to the maintenance and preservation of ecosystem and its
                biodiversity. It is one of the finest picturesque campuses in India.
